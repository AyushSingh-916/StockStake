# Stock Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for fetching, analyzing, and predicting stock prices for top companies listed in Nifty 50. Utilizing powerful Python libraries such as `yfinance` for data fetching, `pandas` for data manipulation, `sklearn` for advanced predictive modeling, and `plotly` for interactive data visualization, this project aims to offer detailed insights into stock market trends.

## Features
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- **Financial Analysis**: Compute various financial ratios and indicators to assess the financial health and stability of companies.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement RandomForestRegressor from `sklearn` to forecast future stock prices with enhanced accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize `plotly` to create dynamic, interactive graphs that allow for an intuitive understanding of stock trends and model predictions.
